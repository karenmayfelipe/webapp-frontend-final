                                    As a simple device supporting a lever, the fulcrum plays a key role in lightening the load. As a name, it signals the company’s commitment to collaborating with our partners and customers. In 2012, Fulcrum brought together local roasters Urban City (1993) and Silver Cup (1994) under one roof with a vision to elevate our approach to coffee and service. We established Fulcrum as a house of premium coffee brands, adding single origin coffees. We kept the two brands (Silver Cup + Urban City) to honor its legacy and history, as well as the precious relationships we have built with existing customers. Originally born as a full-service, wholesale coffee supplier, Fulcrum entered the consumer market in 2017 with a website launch, and in 2018 with the opening of the brick and mortar Fulcrum Café. We are constantly growing and evolving all three brands under the Fulcrum umbrella.

                                    As a fifth-generation Costa Rican coffee farmer, Blas knows how much work goes into every cup of coffee. That’s why he treats each bean with respect. An experienced roaster and an SCAA Licensed Q Grader since 2010, he oversees Fulcrum’s coffee program while constantly learning and honing his unique coffee sensibilities. Blas travels often, hand-selecting green coffees, building lasting relationships with farmers, and helping them implement sustainable practices.

                                <p>Taste is the very first reason. From the frappes to their smoothies to their cakes and especially their meals. Nothing beats it from a coffee shop perspective. The food is fantastic. It includes cheese burger, their banoffee pie, their signature frappucinos, and their lattes. Yum, yum, and yum!
                                    <p class="mb-0">
                                <p>The price is definitely upscale but probably the most affordable from all upscale coffee shops around. That is what value for money means!
                                    <p class="mb-0">
                                <p>Unlike other coffee shops that serve their hot coffee in a covered cup and hides all their errors or mess inside, this one serves it in a cup where you could see the artistry of their obviously skilled baristas. They call it coffee art!
                                    <p class="mb-0">
                                <p>Their staff are knowledgable. You can ask them what a cold brew is, what a latte is, and they will answer you with a straight face, unlike other coffee shops. Try asking around and you will know what i mean.
                                    <p class="mb-0">
                                <p>While this is hot during the day (and they probably should put an umbrella outside so it can be used in the afternoons), it is perfect at night. There's actually a fresh breeze that gives you a relaxing feeling!
                                    <p class="mb-0">
                                <p>The ambiance is gorgeous! Talk about lots of painting materials that look expensive. steel and wood althroughout. It feels like you are not in the philippines when you are inside. It adds to the overall experience. It works for me!
